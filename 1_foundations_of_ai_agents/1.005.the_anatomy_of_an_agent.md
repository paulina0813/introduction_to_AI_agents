# The Anatomy of an Agent

You've just joined TripTech, a startup building an AI travel agent called TravelBuddy to compete with traditional booking sites. It's your first week, and you're in the architecture planning meeting.

The CTO draws three boxes on the white board labeled Model, Tools, and Orchestration and turns to the team:

"We've listed all the capabilities TravelBuddy needs. Before we start coding, let's make sure everyone understands which component handles what. Can you help organize these features into the right architectural components?"

## Instructions
Help design TravelBuddy by dragging each capability to the correct component.
