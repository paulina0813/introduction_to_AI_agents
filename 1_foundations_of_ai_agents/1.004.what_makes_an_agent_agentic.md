## The Agentic Trinity: Model, Tools, and Orchestration
When you give the prompt, three essential components worked together: the model, tools, and the orchestration layer

### The Model

You can think of the model as the brain. This is a large language model that understood your request and figured out what steps to take.

#### The Agentic Trinity: Model
**Prompt:** Jeeves, I am travelling to Tokyo on June 26 and staying there until July 12. help organize my trip.
- "I need to access your itinerary and calendar"
- "I need to access your email and calendar to see your meeting schedule"
- "I need to find flights that are compliant with company policy"
- "I need to find compliant hotels that are close to your meetings"
- "I need to communicate the travel arrangements in a digestible format"


### The Tools

The tools are a way to interact with the world. Tools extend the model's ability to get up-to-date information, perform actions, and interact with digital interfaces.

Tools are essential for bridging the gap between the model and the real world

#### The Agentic Trinity: Tools
To help build your travel plans, Jeeves:
- Accessed your calendar
- Checked company travel policies
- Searched Expedia and Booking.com for the best flights and hotels

### The Orchestration Layer

The orchestration layer is a continuous loop that controls how an agent processes information, remembers information, and makes decisions.

It manages the agent's decision-making cycle: it takes in data, thinks about what it means, and decides what to do next. It also keeps track of everything the agent has done so far. This cycle spins until the agent achieves its goal or hits a predetermined stopping point.

This orchestration layer can be simple, like following basic if-then rules, or mor esophisticated involving complex reasoning chains and even other AI models.
