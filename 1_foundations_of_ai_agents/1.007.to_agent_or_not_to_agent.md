# To Agent or Not to Agent

## Scenario A - Customer Support Team A
The majority of the support claims hace the following qualities. problem qualities:
- They require simple decision-makinh
- They do not require accessing customer information and history
- They all hace discrete predictable answers

## Scenario B - Customer Support Team B
The majority of the support claims hace the following qualities. problem qualities:
- They require complex decision-making
- They requiere accessing customer information ans history
- They require adoptive solutions

## Need for AI Agent
In this case, Customer Support Team A does not need an AI agent and can opt for:
- A simple chatbot trained on pre-trained knowledge
- No tool use or action is required

In this case, Customer Support Team B would benefit from:
- Agenic solution with tool access (customer data)
- Can generate remediation strategies, implement them, and update customer support systems with them

## When to Use AI Agents

### Criteria for using AI Agents
You should use an AI Agent when:
1. Require complex decision-making
2. Require heavy reliance on unstructured data
3. Have difficult to maintain rules
4. Require adaptive problem solving

### Examples of agentic use cases
1. Autonomous customer support systems
2. Coding assistants that can read code bases, provide updates, and implement them automatically
3. A deep research assistant that can synthesize research

## The AI Agents Tooling Ecosystem
![The AI Agents Tooling Ecosystem](<The AI Agents Tooling Ecosystem.png>)

The AI Agents tooling space is dynamic and quickly changing. It operates on a spectrum that goes from:
- Off-the-shelf tooling -> allows you to use an agentic system to tackle a specific problem - such as AI assisted coding, or deep research. Examples:
    - Windsurf
    - Cursor
    - Gemini
    
    Characteristics:
    - Focused on specific domains
    - Easy to use
    - Not customizable

- Low-code / No-code tools -> will enable you to build low agency maturity level workflows. The next generation of workflow automation tools. Examples:
    - n8n
    - Gumloop
    - zapier

    Characteristics:
    - Can expand to multiple domains
    - Accessible
    - Customizable to a degree

- AI Agent frameworks -> they let you build agentic systems from scratch -- which are most widely used by developers to build truly robust systems. Examples:
    - LangGraph
    - CrewAI
    - LlamaIndex

    Characteristics
    - Scalable to all domains
    - Higher barrier to entry
    - Highly customizable

## Build vs Buy: a Famework
- Off-the-Shelf Tools
    - Tackling a specific domain or use-case (e.g. AI-assisted coding)
    - Mature, well-tested solution already exists in the market
    - Want to minimize maintenance overhead
- Low-Code / No-Code Platforms
    - Need some customization but not complete control
    - Workflows are moderately complex but follow common patterns
    - Want business users to modify the agent without engineering help
    - Need to integrate with existing systems quickly
- Agent Frameworks (Build)
    - Use case involves propietary systems
    - Handling sensitive data
    - Agent is core to competitive advantage
    - No existing solution meets specialized requirements
    - Need complete control over agent's behavior and evolution
