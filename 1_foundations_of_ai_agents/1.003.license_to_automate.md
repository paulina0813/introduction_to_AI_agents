As part of your work advising a retail company on AI Agents, they've organized a design thinking workshop to identify potential agentic use-cases for their organization.

The white board is filled with sticky notes describing different use-cases they're considering investing in.

The Head of Innovation turns to you:

"We've brainstormed four use-cases we want to prioritize, can you help identify which ones are agentic and which ones are not?"

## Instructions
Help the team by dragging each system into the correct category based on whether it needs agent capabilities or not.
