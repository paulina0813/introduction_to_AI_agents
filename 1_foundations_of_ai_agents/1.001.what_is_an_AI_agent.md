# What is an AI Agent?

## Course Objectives
- Understand the core compnents that make up an AI Agent
- Distinguish agents from other AI systems you might already know or use
- Use off-the-shelf agentic tool or even building your own

## Steps taken by AI Agent
1. Reasoning and Planning - figuring out the necessary steps and tools needed to fulfill the request correctly
2. Taking Action - execute the plan using the tools provided to him

### Example
**PROMPT:** I'm travelling to Tokyo on June 26 and staying there until July 12. Help organize my trip

#### Reasoning and Planning
1. Access your itinerary and calendar
2. Identify where you'll need to stay based on your meeting schedule
3. Identify relevant flights and hotels
4. Communicate the plan back to you
5. And finally, organize your travels

#### Taking Action
1. Access your calendar and email to understand your itinerary and meetings
2. Access documentation on your company travel policy to ensure compliance
3. Acess Expedia and Booking.com to determine the best flights and hotels
4. Communicates plan, and, once agreed, books travel arrangements

## AI Agents: Reasoning, Planning, and Acting
An AI model capable of reasoning, planning, and acting on a set of actions by interacting with its environment.

The agent has 2 main parts:
1. The brain: the AI model that handles reasoning and planning. It decides which actions to take based on the situation
2. The body: representing everything the agent is able to do, through tools

These systems are agentic because they have agency, which means they can interact with the real world, using these capabilities and tools

**Formal Definition:** An agent is a system that leverages an AI model to interact with its environment to achieve a user-defined objective. It combines reasoning, planning, and the execution of actions (often via external tools) to fullfill tasks.

### The Spectrum of "Agency"

|Level|Agency|Description|Examples|
|---|---|---|---|
|0|No Agency|Systems that can only respond based on trained knowledge or perform discrete, pre-defined tasks|Chatbots with trained knowledge (e.g. GPT-4o), workflow automation systems
|1|Basic routing|AI models that can route scenarios in workflows|A customer support workflow where an AI model routes a ticket based on its content|
|2|Tool-using agents|Sysems that can utilize external tools to achieve a user-defined objective|A travel AI agent that can book flights|
|3|Muti agent systems|Systems that can perform multiple steps simultaneously|Deep research tools that can perform multi-step reasoning and tool calling|
|4|Multi agent systems|Systems that can delegate workflows to multiple agents|Coding assistants that can ideate, generate, and push code to an existing codebase|
