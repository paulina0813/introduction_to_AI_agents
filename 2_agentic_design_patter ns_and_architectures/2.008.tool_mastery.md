# Tool Mastery 
During a SmartCorp planning meeting, the Product Manager looks puzzled about APIs. The team discussed using three tools for the agent: the customer database, a custom function, and the Google Maps API. Only one was called an "API" and the PM asks: "Can you explain what makes something an API and why only Google Maps qualifies?"

Which explanation would best help the Product Manager understand what APIs are?

## Possible Answers
1. APIs are premium services we pay for. Google Maps costs money, but our database and shipping function are free since we built them. That's why only Google Maps is an API - it's about the business model.
2. An API is a standardized way to request services from external software systems. The Google Maps API lets us ask Google for mapping data using their defined rules.
3. APIs are like apps on your phone - Google Maps is an app, but your database isn't. That's the difference!

## Correct Answer
2. An API is a standardized way to request services from external software systems. The Google Maps API lets us ask Google for mapping data using their defined rules.

APIs are standardized ways to access external services. The Product Manager now understands that Google Maps is an API because it's Google's service accessed through their rules, while internal databases and functions are directly under SmartCorp's control. This clarity helps in making decisions about reliability, costs, and dependencies.
