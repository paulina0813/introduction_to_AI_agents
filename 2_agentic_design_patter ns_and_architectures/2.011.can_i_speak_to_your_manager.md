# Can I Speak to Your Manager?
As part of your work consulting companies on AI agents, you helped TechFlow, a retailer, build a new multi-agent customer support system that handles customer queries.

A user just submitted: "I was charged twice for my premium subscription last month. I need a refund for the duplicate charge ASAP!"

The system uses a manager pattern where a central manager agent coordinates with specialized agents in legal, product, and billing.

## Instructions
The system logs show all the steps, but they're out of order. Arrange them correctly to show how the manager pattern processes this billing issue.

## Items
1. Manager receives request and analyzes: "This is a billing issue requiring refund processing"
2. Billing agent reports back to Manager: "Refund confirmed, 3-5 business days"
3. Billing agent investigates payment records and processes refund
4. Manager routes to Billing agent with full context about duplicate charge
5. Manager responds to customer with empathetic message and refund confirmation details
