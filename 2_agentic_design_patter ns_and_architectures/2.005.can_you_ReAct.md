# Can you ReAct?

Your company just launched “CalculateGPT,” a custom AI assistant for financial calculations. Curious whether the ReAct framework improves accuracy and transparency, you decide to test it experimentally. You run a side-by-side comparison using two prompts—one with ReAct prompting and one without:

## Prompt 1:
```
Our Q3 revenue was $847,000. We spent 23% on salaries, 15% on marketing, 
and had a one-time equipment purchase of $45,000. 
What was our net profit? Only return the answer
```

## Prompt 2:
```
Our Q3 revenue was $847,000. We spent 23% on salaries, 15% on marketing, 
and had a one-time equipment purchase of $45,000. What was our net profit?

Please solve this step-by-step using this format:

Thought: [What you need to calculate]
Action: [The calculation]
Observation: [The result]
Continue until you reach the final answer.
```

Knowing that the real answer is $480,140, what key difference did you likely observe between the responses? (Select all that apply)
