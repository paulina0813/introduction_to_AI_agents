# Do Agents Think of Electric Sheep? The ReAct Framework

## The Different Type of Modelo Thoughts
- Planning -> where models break down a problem into small steps
- Analysis -> where models draw insights based on observations
- Decision-making -> where models make specific decisions based on inputs
- Problem-soliving -> where models theorize about what could be the root cause of a problem
- Memory-integration thoughts -> where models remember details stored in their memory
- Self-reflection -> where models reflect on the style and quality of their output
- Goal-setting -> where models determine important goals for them to be able to solve the presented objective
- Prioritization -> where models determine the priority levels of different tasks

|Thoight|Exmple|
|---|---|
|Planning|"To help them move apartments, I'll need to find moving companies, compare prices, check availability for their date"|
|Analysis|"Looking at their spending patterns, they're overpaying for subscriptions they arrely use"|
|Decision-making|"Since they need it by tomorrow, I should suggest express shipping despite the extra cost"|
|Problem-solving|"To optimize this code, I should first prodile it to identify bottlenecks"|
|Memory integration|"They mentioned being lactose intolerant last week, so I'll exclude dairy from these recipe suggestions"|
|Self-reflection|"I was too technical in my explanation - let me simplify this using everyday analogies"|
|Goal-setting|"Before planning their workout routine, I need to understand their fitness level and available time"|
|Prioritization|"They should book the flights before the hotel, since flight proces increase faster"|

## The ReAct Framework: Where Thoughts Come From
ReAct is a prompting framework that combines "Reasoning" and "Acting". It encourages models to break down the problem into thoughts and actions.

It helps models better reason, by adopting chain-of-thought prompting, which is essentially telling the model to "think step by step"

It helps model take better action, by providing concrete examples showing the types of thoughts, actions, and observations a model can make to solve specific problems

- Reasoning
    - Chain of thought prompting
        - [Prompt...]. Think step by step
- Acting
    - Thought > Action > Observation examples
        - Thought: [Think about what to calculate first]
        - Action: [Perform calculation]
        - Observation: [Result of calculation]
        - ...repeat as needed...
        - Final Answer: [Complete solution]


## ReAct as a Way of Thinking
ReAct is part of the model's system prompt
- System prompts are hidden instructions that tell the modelo how ot behave throughout all conversations

## Reasoning Models and ReAct
- ReAct is especially useful on "traditional" language models like the GPT-series of models
- Newer generation reasoning models are explicitly trained to think step by step, and don't need ReAct prompting
- Example of reasoning models
    - OpenAI o-series of models
    - DeepSeek R-series of models
    - Gemini thinking models
