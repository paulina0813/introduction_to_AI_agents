# What's in the (Tool) Box?

Tool use is essential for making AI systems truly agentic. Without tools they can only generate responses and lack the crucial "Agency" that enables them to interact with the external world.

## The Different Type of Tools

### 1. Extensions
Tools that connect agents to the outside world through application programming interfaces or APIs for short, or emerging protocols like the Model Context Protocol, or MCP for short.

#### Application Programming Interface
Set of rules that lets different software systems talk to each other and share data or functionality in a structured way.

They act as messengers between software applications, taking a reqest to a system and receiving a response containing data or services

##### Extending Agent Capabilities with APIs
- Prompt
    - What's the stock price of Nvidia today?
- Tool use
    - Yahoo Finance API
- Response
    - Nvidia's stock price today is $141.97

#### Model Context Protocol
An open standard that lets AI Assistants connect to external data sources and tools through a unified interface

### 2. Functions
Tools that lets agents execute a specific set of code. Functions let agents execute a specific set of code

#### Functions: Custom Abilities
These are like custom tools you give your agent designed for your specfic needs.

#### Improving Capabilities with Functions
Imagine you're extending your financial advisor agent's capabilities to also provide analysis on stock data
- Prompt
    - Analyze Nvidia's stock performance over the last 30 days
- Tool Use
    - Yahoo Finance API
    - Calculates moving averages function
    - Analyst report on the semi-conductor industry
- Response
    - Nvidia's stock price today is $141.97. Over the past 30 days, the moving average increased by 10% over the historical average

### 3. Data Stores
Tools that lets agents retrieve information from databases and documents

#### Data Stores: Retrieving Information
Data stores let agents retrieve information from databases and documents. This can be structured data, like databases, excel files, product directories, and more. Or unstructured data like video, audio, PDFs, emails, and text files
- Structured data
    - Tabular data
    - Databases, Excel Files, Directories, etc
- Unstructured data
    - Text, image, video, audio data
    - PDFs, email, company reports, etc...

## The Tool Box
If you're building agents, both low-code/no-code agent builders and agentic frameworks come with a set of pre-loaded tools you can rely on.

If you want to use tools customized to your specific use case, you'll probably have to create them yourself
