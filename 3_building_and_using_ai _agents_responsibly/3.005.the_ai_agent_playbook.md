# The AI Agent Playbook
You've been appointed as Chief AI Officer at GlobalTech Solutions. After seeing both successful agent deployments and costly failures across the industry, the board has tasked you with creating the company's official "AI Agent Usage Policy." This document will guide two groups: engineers building custom agents and employees using off-the-shelf agent tools.

Your policy draft has mixed up guidelines for builders and users. Time to sort them out!

## Instructions
Organize these best practices into the correct section of your policy document.
