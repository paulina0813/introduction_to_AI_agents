# Safety First
As part of your role at OpenBI, you are building a new customer-facing financial advisory agent. After seeing what went wrong at other companies - agents leaking customer data, giving terrible investment advice, and even responding rudely - your CEO mandates: "We need comprehensive guardrails from day one. I want you to map out exactly where each protection goes in our system."

Your task is to place each guardrail at the correct point in the agent's processing flow.

## Instructions
Drag each guardrail to where it belongs in the agent architecture.
