# Agentic Systems in the Real World

## Best Practices when using an off-the-shelf tool
These tools can range from coding assistants to deep research assistants, and more. For example:
- Windsurf
- Cursor
- Gemini

### Best Practices
- Design useful prompts with context
    - Effective prompt patterns
        - Detailed examples of what good looks like
        - Context for the task being worked on
    - AI-assisted coding use-case: Updating the code
        - Detailed examples of what final code should look like
        - Context of the original code, and why it needs updating
- Understand the agent's capabilities and limitations
    - What tools does it have access to?
    - How up to date is the model information?
- Always verify your agent's output
    - Agents are powered by large language models, which can hallucinate or misinterpret data, especially in complex scenarios
- Always be mindful of costs
    - Many agentic tools operate on a pay-per-use pricing model and let you switch between large language model providers
    - Having a good understanding of how expensive running one large language model is vs another can help you balance performance needs with budget constraints
- Use AI Agents responsibly
    - Even with guardrails, be cautious about sharing confidential data or personally identifiable information with third-party tools
    - Assume anything you sare could be logged or used for training unless explicitly stated otherwise


## Best Practices for Designing and Building AI Agents
Examples:
- Low-code/No-code tools
    - n8n
    - Gumloop
    - zapier
- AI agent frameworks
    - LangGraph
    - CrewAI
    - LlamaIndex

### Best Practices
- Always design for human intervention
    - No matter how sophisticated your agent, there will be edge cases it can't handle
    - Build in clear escalation paths - when should the agent hand off to a human? How does it signal uncertainty?
- Critically evaluate if you even need an agent
    - Agents excel at complex decisions, unstructured data, and adaptive problem-solving. 
    - If your workflow is predictable and rule-based, traditional automation might be better
- Be mindful of costs and performance trade-offs
    - Each model call, tool use, and reasoning cycle costs time and money
        - You should consider deeply how many times your agent will be called every day. what the expected ROIs for the system, versus de projected costs
- Start simple and iterate
    - Begin with a single agent and basic tools 
    - Add complecity only when you hit clear limitations
    - It's easier to expand a working system than to debug an over-engineered one
- Monitor and measure everything
    - Track success rates, response times, costs, and user satisfaction
